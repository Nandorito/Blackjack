# Blackjack
Text based Blackjack with OOP

I made a header file for each class and gradually introduced them into the main BlackjackGame.cpp file.

Immediately following a header file, that classes functions are next. 

There are still a few bugs in regards to input that may cause some infinite loops. I will get to them when I can. For now, I will be moving on to future projects. 

Main function is near the end with ostream function calls. 

Run exe and enjoy!
